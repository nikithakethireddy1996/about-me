I had completed my batchelors of degree with the background of computer science. I had worked some projects based on excel. I think the knowledge i gained during my degree and through the projects i have done is not sufficient enough for me to achieve my goal in real world practise. And thats the main reason why i have come all the way long from india to do my masters and upgrade my technical skills so that they help me to achieve my goal and build a successful carrier.

Currently the only goal i have is to gain more and more knowledge in programming languages so that it would lead me to build a great career. I would like to see myself developing a web pages and just bring them into the IT world.
